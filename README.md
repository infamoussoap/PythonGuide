# Python Guide
Python alternative to the book Matlab Guide by Desmond J. Higham and Nicholas J. Higham

## Motivation
Many of my opinions have changed as the years go by. But one that has remain static is my disdain for Matlab. This Python Guide is a culmination of my knowledge of Python, but also the contempt I hold for Matlab.
